    <h2> Who am I?</h2>
    
    <p>My name is Clayton Crawford. I am currently pursuing my Associate of Science in Computer Informatics. I am a first generation college student and have wanted to work with computers ever since I was a little kid, regardless of how it happened. We did not have a computer in the house when I was growing up which only made my desire to learn about them even stronger. I was born in April of 2000 in Alaska. I have two brothers and one dog.</p>
